We didn't talk about books that day, But our connection felt like a novel in play, Her smile was like the sun in the sky, Radiant and bright, it caught my eye. I couldn't help but stare into her eyes, Like an explorer discovering new skies, Her beauty was like a work of art, A masterpiece that touched my heart. Now I'm in my car and reminisce, About that moment of pure bliss, Her presence left a mark on my soul, A memory that will forever be whole. So I sit and write, Of that unexpected delight, That came to me in the day, And made my pain simply fade away."
